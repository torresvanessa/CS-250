# CS-250 Journal Portfolio
- How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
- How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
- What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Interpreting user needs begins and ends with open communication. User stories start with user ideas which are then written in a standardized format, becoming a “placeholder for communications” to facilitate a medium for for questions, concerns and expansions of project requirements.  Throughout the course, working on the SNHU Travel Project demonstrates the importance of Agile-scrum principles such as working incrementally, embracing changing requirements, open communication and collaboration. The simulated scenarios in CS-250 included the transition from a Waterfall-based project management approach to a Scrum-agile methodology, providing a hands-on case study similar to those we read in the module links and in the textbook.

The Agile processes I hope to incorporate into my future development work include regular sprints and reviews to monitor and adapt the project's progression. Active participation, aligning with the goals of the final product, and contributing to the iterative changes will allow me to become a good team member. Additionally, tools like JIRA, Rally, and VersionOne aid with managing project flow, allowing for adaptations along the way, following the core principles of Agile-scrum. The Software Development Lifestyle course has taught me the principles of the Agile project approach, developing the skills of working dynamically based on ongoing feedback and improving organizational effectiveness.
